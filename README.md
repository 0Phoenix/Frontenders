Front Yard Sale

For our project we are creating a website that is essentially is a bidding/selling site that has many different mechanics that users interact with. At its core, items are put up for auction and bid on by other users. Users and admin will have to create accounts to access this website, complete with authentication and authorization.  Username and password function will be available as well as an option to remain anonymous to other users. 

Once logged in users will be able to view items that are up for sale as well as sell items. These items will be sorted based on popularity. Users can sale items by inputting the information that is required as well as a time period for bidding. While the bidding time is open, users are able to view and increase the price of items. Once the time is up, the highest bidder will have the item added to their personal checkout cart. 

The checkout cart functionality will let users see what they have successfully bid on and have the ability to remove items from the cart. To avoid users from abusing the system and cancelling all their successful bids there will be a strike system that will lead to a userâ€™s permanent ban on the website. Admins will also be able to ban users as well.

If a user cancels their bid on an item, that item is given back to the owner of that item. The user can then decide what they want to do, resubmit the item or take it off the market.

Recommended items will also be viewable to users based on keywords.

Multiple clients will have access to server that contains the information about the biddable items.
