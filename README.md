Front Yard Sale
For our project we are creating a website that is essentially 




For this proposal we would have a website that contains items available for purchase. These items would purchasable by bidding and going to the highest bidder in a certain amount of time. This will be done by allowing multiple clients access to a server that contains the information about the biddable items.
