Front Yard Sale

**Problem Statement:

For our project we are creating a website that is essentially is a bidding/selling site that has many different mechanics that users interact with. At its core, items are put up for auction and bid on by other users.

**List of users: 

Clients – people that create accounts to auction and bid
Admins – people who have the ability to monitor activity on the website

**List of functionalities provided for each user:

Users and admin will have to create accounts to access this website, complete with authentication and authorization. Username and password function will be available as well as an option to remain anonymous to other users. Information for the account will include username, password, email, and anonymous ID.

Once logged in users will be able to view items that are up for sale as well as sell items. These items will be sorted based on popularity. Users can sale items by inputting the information that is required as well as a time period for bidding. Sellers can also set a starting price as well as a max bid for an outright purchase. 

While the bidding time is open, users are able to view and increase the price of items. Sellers can set the increment on prices or the bid. Once the time is up, the highest bidder will have the item added to their personal checkout cart. If there is a bidding war occurring, the timer will be extended. The bid timer will also give warnings when the bid is about to finish.

The checkout cart functionality will let users see what they have successfully bid on and have the ability to remove items from the cart. To avoid users from abusing the system and cancelling all their successful bids there will be a strike system that will lead to a user’s permanent ban on the website. Admins will also be able to ban users if they are abusing the system.

If a user cancels their bid on an item, that item is given back to the owner of that item. The user can then decide what they want to do, resubmit the item or take it off the market. Recommended items will also be viewable to users based on keywords. Items for bid will be able to be categorized, letting other users search/filter for specific items.

Multiple clients will have access to server that contains the information about the biddable items.

**List of potential technologies being used: 

Since each user will have an account, we will need to use a database system to store all of the users and the items the users are auctioning. We will also need user interface for users to interact with the items they are bidding for. Additionally we will need a hypertext translators from html to the database. XAMPP will most likely be used to for the whole system since it contains both front end and back end applications.
